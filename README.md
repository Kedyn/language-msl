# mIRC Script Language Syntax for Linguist

This was a clone of [Kedyn/vscode-mirc](https://github.com/Kedyn/vscode-mirc) which is a fork of [lol2k/vscode-mirc](https://github.com/lol2k/vscode-mirc).

I am attempting to add msl support to [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/) and for some reason, the grammar checker keeps going back to the original source which has errors. So I cloned the 'updated' repo and am trying to fix things up.

Both source repos are under MIT license so afaik I can do this.
